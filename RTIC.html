          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The RTIC Soft Pack 30 is a semi-structured soft side cooler by RTIC Coolers that retails for $99 before tax
            and shipping. RTIC is probably best
            recognized as "that company that was legally entagled with Yeti", however this doesnt mean they dont produce
            quality coolers. RTIC markets itself as "overbuilt, not overpriced" implying performance over
            branding and image.</p>

          <p>The Soft Pack has an interior volume of 22 quarts which translates to approximately
            28 pounds of ice, roughly 3 bags of your typical mini-mart cubed ice. RTIC doesn't make any claims about how
            long the Soft Pack holds ice, however it does claim capacity for 30 cans plus ice. RTIC also claims the
            zipper to be leakproof. We'll take a look at these claims in greater detail this review</p>

          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">First Impression</h3>

          <p>The RTIC shipped quickly from the manufacturer and arrived in a box displaying the brand name. Included
            with the cooler is a small tube of lubrication for the lid zipper. The zipper is quite stout, definitely a
            two-handed operation to open and close the lid, but this helps insulation and waterproofing. The zipper has
            a robust rubber tag handle which provides a good gripping point to open and close the cooler. Additionally,
            there is a small front pocket with zipper however not enough volume to store anything meaningfully large.

            <p>The cooler is constructed from a heavy vinyl, the handles are solidly stiched to the sides. Despite being
              a soft-side cooler, its rigid enough to hold 25 pounds of weight (confirmed by test) on the lid with only
              minor flexing.</p>

          <a name="capacity"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Capacity Test</h3>
          <p>RTIC claims 30 can plus ice. In our test, 30 cans is possible however not much room is left for ice to
            surround every can, but several cans could be chilled. If you're not a fast drinker, this may work for you.
            If you plan on using this cooler to carry 30 cans and ice, it would be best to pre-chill the cans.
          </p>
          <a name="ice"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ice Retention Test</h3>
          <h4>Test Overview</h4>
          <p>We tested this cooler's ability to hold ice under average summer conditions over a 24 hour period,
            beginning at noon. As
            with all tests we do, the average high temperature was approximately 80-85 degrees, the average low was
            approximately 60-65 degrees. The cooler was exposed to a mixture of direct sunlight, shade and some cloud
            obstructed sunlight over the test period simulating an average campsite, boat deck or other outdoor usage
            scenario. Exposure to hotter
            temperatures or more direct sunlight without shade will obviously alter ice retention results. </p>
          <h4>Test results</h4>
          <p>The test was started with 10.2 lbs of ice, and after 24 hours the cooler had retained 4.52 pounds, rough
            44%, plenty to keep drinks cold and preserve food into a second day. This ice retention performance is in
            line for the price point of sub-$100 soft sided coolers and is definitely enough for the typical soft side
            cooler intended usage.</p>
          <p>An additional note, once the cooler had melted ice, we rolled it around and tipped it upside down to test
            the claim of the zipper being waterproof. Not a drop of water leaked. </p>
          <a name="summary"></a>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>In our opinion, RTIC lives up to its tagline of "overbuilt, not overpriced" with the Soft Pack line. Ice retention is more than
            meets expectations for the price range and will get you into a second day before needing to refill with ice. Build quality exceeds expectations for the price
            level, particularly the leak-proof zipper.</p>
          <h4>Key Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>44% of ice Retained after 24 hours - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Capacity for 30 cans + 8 pounds of ice - Confirmed by test, however this is a stretch. 12-18 cans plus
              10 pounds of ice is more realistic</li>
            <li>Soft-Sided, yet robust enough to hold weight on the lid allowing for stacking when loading the back of a car.</li>
          </ul>
