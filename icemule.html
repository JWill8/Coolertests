          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>This softside, backpack cooler by Icemule is intended to be a convenient and easy to transport cooler for
            short day
            trips when dragging full sized cooler isn't needed. The Classic Medium is a 15 litre capacity cooler that
            the manufacturer claims can hold 12 cans with the necessary ice for 24 hours of cooling. </p>

          <p>Unlike other softside coolers, this cooler has no zippers, but rather the top rolls down and staps
            similar to a dry-bag used in water sports. Once loaded, you roll the top of the cooler down to the level of
            the ice, and clip it shut. Air escapes from the inside of the cooler via a valve (pictured) and once
            clipped, the valve is closed. The lack of structure to this cooler is actually a useful feature because as
            you use the contents of the cooler, it becomes smaller and more packable.</p>
          <p>The Icemule Medium can be stashed in the hatch of an average kayak as well. The flexible, compressible
            structure as well as the lack
            of zippers (which can leak), make this a good option for kayakers. </p>

          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">First Impression</h3>

          <p>The build quality of this cooler is solid, with strong stiching and strap clip points firmly glued to the
            body of
            the cooler giving the impression that the straps can withstand being carried, swung or otherwise stressed
            while loaded with 20 pounds of ice and cans. The bottom of the cooler, which will rest on
            the ground, is a ruggedized vinyl that seems like it will not struggle to withstand sand, gravel, rocks and
            other surfaces this cooler is likely to be placed on. </p>
          <p>The included straps are comforable and provide an ergonomic way to transport 12 cans with ice in situatoins
            where youre carrying the cooler over distances, like say going to the beach where you commonly have to park
            significant distances from the actual shoreline.</p>

          <a name="capacity"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Capacity Test</h3>
          <p>We found that the manufacturer's claims of capacity for 12 cans plus "ice" to be true, although the amount
            of ice is not defined in this claim. With the average bag
            of ice weighing 8-10 lbs, we assumed the average user would be picking up such a bag at a mini mart and
            throwing
            the full bag of ice in with the 12 cans. This amount of ice fits with 12 cans and was validated by our
            testing.
          </p>
          <a name="ice"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ice Retention Test</h3>
          <h4>Test Overview</h4>
          <p>We tested this cooler's ability to hold ice under average summer conditions over a 24 hour period,
            beginning at noon. As
            with all tests we do, the average high temperature was approximately 80-85 degrees, the average low was
            approximately 60-65 degrees. The cooler was exposed to a mixture of direct sunlight, shade and some cloud
            obstructed sunlight over the test period simulating an average campsite, boat deck or other outdoor usage
            scenario. Exposure to hotter
            temperatures or more direct sunlight without shade will obviously alter ice retention results. </p>
          <h4>Test results</h4>
          <p>The cooler was placed into the test conditions with 8.05 lbs of ice and after 24 hours had retained 1.47
            lbs,
            translating to roughly a 18% ice retention rate, certainly enough to get you through the average day at the
            beach or the typical single-day use for this cooler. The manufacturer claims the cooler will hold ice for 24
            hours which has been validated. As with all coolers, warmer temps will alter these results, but its
            reasonable to believe based on these results, even in warmer temps, this cooler will hold ice for most of
            the day.</p>
          <a name="summary"></a>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The Ice Mule Classic- Medium provides a comfortable way to carry ice and drinks in a compressible, packable
            design. It's capable of holding ice for a full 24 hours, well built and a good value for times when you only
            need a day trip's worth of ice and dont want to carry the weight and bulk of a soft side cooler built to
            hold ice for 2+ days. For this purpose, at this
            price point, the Ice Mule line meets the mission.</p>
          <h4>Key Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ice Retention for 24 hours and beyond - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Capacity for 12 cans + 8 pounds of ice - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Stores flat, saving space</li>
            <li>Packable, compressible, light weight, comfortable to carry while loaded</li>
          </ul>
