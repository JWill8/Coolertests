          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Produced by AO coolers, the 24 can canvas cooler is intended for day trips where the bulk and size of a
            full-sized,
            hard sided cooler isnt needed. If you're here, its probably because you searched for "soft sided coolers" on
            amazon and AO coolers appeared in the results. AO doesnt have the marketing reach that Yeti or even RTIC
            has, but this doesnt necessarily mean they dont stack up.
            According to the manufacturer, the product dimensions are 17" length x 10" width x 12" height with enough
            interior capacity for 14 pounds of ice and 24, 12 ounce cans.</p>

          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">First Impression</h3>

          <p>The build quality of this cooler is very good, with handles straps being firmly stitched to the body of the
            cooler.
            The handles are joined by a strong velcro band that is comforable to hold while the cooler is fully loaded.
            The removable shoulder
            strap is wide with a plastic pad providing grip on your shoulder preventing annoying
            sliding. The zipper is robust and operates smoothly and the zipper tag does not feel likely to break. The
            canvas is thick and feels as if it'll withstand typical abrasion and even some abuse.</p>

          <a name="capacity"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Capacity Test</h3>
          <p>We found that the manufacturer's claims of capacity for 24 cans plus 14 pounds of ice to be true, however
            this is definitely the maximum. With the average bag of ice weighing 8-10 lbs, carrying a 24 pack with ice
            is realistic with this cooler if the cans are properly spaced. However, ff the cans are room temperature
            prior to
            being put into the cooler, I would not expect all 24 to be chilled to drinking temps with this arrangement.
          </p>
          <a name="ice"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ice Retention Test</h3>
          <h4>Test Overview</h4>
          <p>We tested this cooler's ability to hold ice under average summer conditions over a 24 hour period,
            beginning at noon. As
            with all tests we do, the average high temperature was approximately 80-85 degrees, the average low was
            approximately 60-65 degrees. The cooler was exposed to a mixture of direct sunlight, shade and some cloud
            obstructed sunlight over the test period simulating an average campsite, boat deck or other outdoor usage
            scenario. Exposure to hotter
            temperatures or more direct sunlight without shade will obviously alter ice retention results. </p>
          <h4>Test results</h4>
          <p>The cooler was placed into the test conditions with 8.0 lbs of ice and after 24 hours had retained 3.6 lbs,
            translating to roughly a 45% ice retention rate. The manufacturer claims the cooler will hold ice in 120
            degree temps, based on these results it is reasonable to believe that this is the case, probably not more
            than a few cubes in cold water, but ice nonetheless.</p>
          <a name="summary"></a>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The AO Cooler's 24 Can Canvas Cooler is a good option for those needing only a day's worth of ice in an
            comfortable to carry, ergonomic package. The canvas sides allow it to be flexible while packing and storing
            away while still holding its rectangular shape when being used. A good, well built value at this price
            point. </p>
          <h4>Key Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ice Retention for 24 hours and beyond - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Capacity for 24 cans + ice - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Can be partially flattened while storing, saving space</li>
            <li>Solid build quality</li>
          </ul>
