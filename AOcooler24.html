          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Produced by AO coolers, this canvas cooler is intended for day trips to the park, on the boat, to sporting
            events or other outdoor events where the bulk and size of a full-sized hard sided cooler isnt needed.
            According to the manufacturer, the product dimensions are 17" length x 10" width x 12" height with enough
            interior capacity for 14 pounds of ice and 24, 12 ounce cans.</p>

          <p>The build quality of this cooler is very good, with handles straps being firmly stitched to the body of the
            cooler.
            The handles are joined by a strong velcro band that is comforable to hold while the cooler is fully loaded.
            The removable shoulder
            strap is wide with a plastic pad providing grip on your shoulder preventing annoying
            sliding. The zipper is robust and operates smoothly and the zipper tag does not feel likely to break. The
            canvas is thick and feels as if it'll withstand abrasion. This
            cooler's build quality feels like it will certainly withstand average usage and even mild
            abuse.</p>

          <h3>Capacity Test</h3>
          <p>We found that the manufacturer's claims of capacity for 24 cans plus 14 pounds of ice to be true, however
            this is definitely the maximum. With the average bag of ice weighing 8-10 lbs, carrying a 24 pack with ice
            is realistic with this cooler if the cans are properly spaced. If the cans are room temperature prior to
            being put into the cooler, I would not expect all 24 to be chilled to drinking temps with this arrangement.
          </p>

          <h3 style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ice Retention Test</h3>
          <h4>Test Overview</h4>
          <p>We tested this cooler's ability to hold ice under average summer conditions over a 24 hour period,
            beginning at noon. As
            with all tests we do, the average high temperature was approximately 83 degrees, the average low was
            approximately 62 degrees. The cooler was exposed to a mixture of direct sunlight, shade and some cloud
            obstructed sunlight over the test period simulating an average campsite, boat deck or other outdoor usage
            scenario. Exposure to hotter
            temperatures or more direct sunlight without shade will obviously alter ice retention results. </p>
          <h4>Test results</h4>
          <p>The cooler was placed into the test conditions with 4.0 lbs of ice and after 24 hours had retained 1.8 lbs,
            translating to roughly a 45% ice retention rate. The manufacturer claims the cooler will hold ice in 120
            degree temps, based on these results it is reasonable to believe that this is the case</p>
          <a name="summary"></a>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>The AO Cooler's 24 Can Canvas Cooler delivers on the most important requirement which is sufficient ice
            retention. Given that the purpose of a cooler in this size range is typically day trips, this cooler is a
            good option for those who want quality but dont need to pay hundreds for multi-day insulation. We found that
            the manufacturer's claims of 24 hour ice retention are supported by real
            world test data. Additionally, the 24 can capacity claim is true. This is a good
            option for situations only requiring a days worth of ice. This cooler is well built and likely to serve well
            for many years.</p>
