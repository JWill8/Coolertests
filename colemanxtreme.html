          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The Xtreme is a hardsided cooler built by campground-mainstay Coleman. Like most Coleman products, they're
            build quality is
            solid enough for the average car camping trip and do what theyre supposed to do. The brand name wont impress
            your campground neighbors, but for those who care about right-sizing their cooler budget for their needs,
            Coleman has always provided a good suite of products. That said, spending under $65 doesnt
            need
            to
            mean no performance, however, the Xtreme claims ice retention for 5 days in 90 degree temps. The specific
            model being used in this test is linked below.</p>

          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">First Impression</h3>

          <p>The build quality of this cooler is what you'd expect from Coleman: a solid feel with
            sturdy hard sides that will withstand a drop from waist height. The lid seals tightly, the
            grab handles are solid, but there are a few noticeable cost cutting measures like plasting hinges that
            regular usage will test over time. The empty weight is around 12 lbs giving some indication of the
            insulation value.</p>

          <a name="capacity"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-top:25px;">Capacity Test</h3>
          <p>This is a 70 quart cooler with stated capacity for 100 cans. This cannot be debated since 70 quarts is
            theoretically enough to hold over 180 12 ounce cans if the interior dimensions of a 70 quart container were
            a perfect cube. 100 cans
            plus ice is completely achievable using math, but we tested it nonetheless. With 100 cans, we were able to
            fit approximately 25 pounds of ice, which based on our ice retention test, would keep those
            100 cans drinkably cold for 3 days.
          </p>
          <a name="ice"></a>
          <h3 style="padding-bottom: 25px;">Ice Retention Test</h3>
          <h4>Test Overview</h4>
          <p>We tested this cooler's ability to hold cubed ice under average summer conditions over a 54 hour period,
            simulating a typical friday morning-to-sunday-afternoon weekend camping trip which we expect to be the
            typical use for this type of cooler.
            beginning at noon on the test day. As
            with all tests we do, the cooler was stocked with cubed ice purchased in bag form, similar to what you'd buy
            en-route to a weekend trip. The average high temperature each day was approximately 85 degrees, the average
            low was
            approximately 65 degrees. The cooler was exposed to a mixture of direct sunlight, shade and some cloud
            obstructed sunlight over the test period simulating an average campsite, boat deck or other outdoor usage
            scenario. Exposure to hotter
            temperatures or more direct sunlight without shade will obviously alter ice retention results. </p>
          <h4>Test results</h4>
          <p>The cooler was placed into the test conditions with 20.4 lbs of ice (in cube form) and after 60 hours (Noon
            on day 1 to 6 pm on day 3) had
            retained 8.92lbs,
            translating to an impressive 43% ice retention rate after 3 afternoon's worth of sun exposure. Its important
            to
            note that the cooler lid was not opened during this time, which helps ice retention. Real world camping
            usage
            would have a lower ice retention due to repeated lid openings, but these results should provide a basis for
            assessing the Coleman Xtreme.</p>
          <h4>Comparing results to the manufacturer's claims</h4>
          <p>The manufacturer claims the cooler will hold ice for 5
            days. Assuming the ice-melt rate we observed in our tests holds constant over a 5 day period, and assuming
            "hold ice for 5 days" means at the
            end of day 5 you have 1 pound of ice remaining, you'd need to start with approximately 30 pounds
            of ice. However, considering that the test cooler remained closed for
            the entire 24 hour test period, real
            world ice
            retention will be lower than this since every time a cooler is opened, warm air enters, accelerating ice
            melt. This means that you'd need to start with something more than 30 lbs. If for the sake of argument, we
            use 35 pounds, This is approximately 42-45 quarts of ice in terms of volume, roughly 60% of the cooler's
            interior volume in the 70 quart model</p>
          <p> So in order to achieve the stated claim of retaining ice
            for 5 days, you'll need to dedicate the majority of the interior volume to ice. This probably doesn't leave
            enough room for 5 days worth of provisions
            unless those items could be stored outside the cooler and cycled in as-needed. In any case, the claim of 5
            days of ice
            renention is upheld, although not probably practical.</p>
          <a name="summary"></a>
          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>Despite our statements about the 5 day claim being impractical in real world usage, The Coleman Xtreme will
            definitely keep enough ice to keep your food and beverages cold for the average
            Friday-morning-to-Sunday-Afternoon weekend trip. Anything beyond that
            will likely need ice refill, so if youre going off-grid for 3+ days, you'll need to use block ice or pay for
            a cooler with more insultation. For the money, this is a well built cooler that
            holds ice for long enough for
            most people's uses and is definitely a good value for the money</p>
          <h4>Key Points</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Held Ice in the sun for 54 hours, sufficient for weekend trips </li>
            <li>Capacity for 100 cans + ice - Confirmed by test</li>
            <li>Durable build quality from a reputable company</li>
          </ul>
